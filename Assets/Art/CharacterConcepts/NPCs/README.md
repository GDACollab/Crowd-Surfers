# NPC Character Concept Art

## Purpose
This directory contains concept art for NPC (Non-Player Character) designs for Crowd Surfers. The goal is to develop visual concepts that fit the theme of a modern world with both Humans and non-Humans.

## Relevant Design Documents

- [Written Pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xS3UR6-c8yf6ozTU9qc_TI3XINv1MaLAIeT8Ejf0JwM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Guidelines

### What to Create
- **Sketches with/without loose coloring**: Concept sketches are not meant to be fully finished pieces
- **Rudimentary ideas**: Focus on exploring what the NPC characters might look like visually
- **Quick brainstorming**: Generate multiple iterations and ideas

### Important Reminders
- ⚠️ **DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME POLISHING** - You might be sad if your iteration isn't selected
- ❌ **Generative AI is NOT allowed** for any of Crowd Surfer's assets
- 💬 **Communicate with your team** - Pass off ideas and provide constructive feedback
- 📸 **Share progress** - Send images of in-progress sketches to the art feedback channel
- 📋 **Refer to Design** - Check the design docs being worked on concurrently

### File Naming Convention
Use descriptive names for your concept art files:
- `NPC_[CharacterType]_[ArtistInitials]_[Version].png/jpg`
- Example: `NPC_StreetVendor_JD_v01.png`
- Example: `NPC_CyberPunk_AS_v02.jpg`

### Organization
- Place all NPC concept sketches directly in this directory
- If creating multiple variations of the same character, use version numbers (v01, v02, etc.)
- Consider creating subdirectories for specific NPC types if the collection grows large

### Workflow
1. Review the design documents linked above
2. Brainstorm and sketch rough concepts
3. Add loose coloring if desired (optional)
4. Share work-in-progress in the art feedback channel
5. Iterate based on team feedback
6. Commit your concepts to this directory

## Deadline
**January 21st, 2026**

## Theme
Modern world setting featuring both **Humans and non-Humans**
